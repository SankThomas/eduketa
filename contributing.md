# Project Structure

This project uses NextJs as the primary framework, and Nextra theme docs as the main theme for the docs.

In order to make a meaningful contribution to this project, please make sure you have a good understanding of NextJs, and a basic understanding of how to work with Markdown, as all pages are written in `MDX`, and since Nextra currently doesn't support the App Router, the project uses the pages router instead.
