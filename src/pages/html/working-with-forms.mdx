# Working With Forms

<Callout type="info">This page is under construction</Callout>

The `form` element is used to create a HTML form which accepts user input. It contains a couple of components for it to be complete.

## 1. The `input` element

The `input` element is used to create an input that users can fill, such as a text input for usernames, or ones that they can select, such as a checkbox or radio button.

It is used to create text fields.

## 2. The `label` element

The `label` is essentially the name of the input. For example, you can have a `label` and then link it to your input so that when the user clicks on the label, it automatically triggers the input.

It is recommended that your inputs should always have labels. You can circumvent this rule though depending on your needs.

## The `submit` button

The submit button is going to trigger the `submit` event of the form so that functions like form validation can run. You can create a submit button using a `button` element, or by using an `input` with a `type` of `submit`, i.e:

```html
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
```

This will render:

<br />

<input type="submit" value="Submit" />

## Form examples

> For reasons that adding demo forms breaks the website (because the form triggers a reload event when it is submitted), I am not showing the demo. However, you can try out the code on your local machine to test out what you will have.

### A form that accepts a username, email and password

```html
<form>
  <label for="username">Username</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    name="username"
    id="username"
    placeholder="Enter your username"
    required
  />

  <label for="email">Enter your email</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    id="email"
    placeholder="Enter your email"
    required
  />

  <label for="password">Enter your password</label>
  <input
    type="password"
    name="password"
    id="password"
    placeholder="Enter your password"
    required
  />

  <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>
```

> I have made a habit of giving the `name` and `id` attributes the same name as the input type I am creating to improve the workflow. However, you can have whatever names you want, as long as you have the correct input type.

### A form with a radio buttons

```html
<form>
  <label for="option1">Option 1</label>
  <input type="radio" name="option1" id="option1" />

  <label for="option2">Option 2</label>
  <input type="radio" name="option2" id="option2" />

  <label for="option3">Option 3</label>
  <input type="radio" name="option3" id="option3" />

  <button type="submit">Next Page</button>
</form>
```

### A form with multiple checkbox options

```html
<form>
  <h2>Please select all options relevant to you</h2>

  <input type="checkbox" name="checkbox1" id="checkbox1" />
  <label for="checkbox1">High School Graduate</label>

  <input type="checkbox" name="checkbox2" id="checkbox2" />
  <label for="checkbox2">Undergraduate Degree</label>

  <input type="checkbox" name="checkbox3" id="checkbox3" />
  <label for="checkbox3">PhD</label>

  <button type="submit">Confirm Selection</button>
</form>
```

## Form Events

Now that we know how to create forms, there are events that go along with the forms. For example, there is a submit event when you submit the form, there is a change event when you change the value of the input by typing something in, among others, which we are going to look at below.

### `onsubmit` event
