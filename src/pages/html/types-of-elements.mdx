# Types of HTML Elements

HTML elements are divided into 2: block elements and inline elements.

## Block Elements

These define elements that always start on a new line when they are declared.

**Examples of block elements**

1. `div`
2. `section`
3. `p`
4. `ul`
5. `ol`
6. All headings (`h1` to `h6`)
7. `table`
8. `form`
9. `article`
10. `main`

Among others...

## Inline Elements

These define elements that continue on the same line in which they are declared. They are usually used within block elements to achieve a certain goal, such as to make text block.

**Example:**

```html
<p>Please ensure you submit your report by <strong>the 8th</strong></p>
```

Above, the paragraph is a block element, and `strong` is an inline element.

**Examples of inline elements**

1. `strong`
2. `b`
3. `mark`
4. `span`
5. `input`
6. `label`
7. `a`
8. `button`
9. `img`
10. `q`
