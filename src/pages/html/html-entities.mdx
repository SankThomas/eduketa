# HTML Entities

HTML possesses some reserved characters. For example, if you want to display a mathematical expression where one number is greater than the other, you might do something like this:

```html
8 > 2
```

However, this might not be the best method because you never know whether the browser will take the ">" symbol and interpret is as a tag. The solution to this is to use HTML Entities.

HTML Entities are used to display reserved characters. For example, the "greater than" symbol will now become `&gt;`

**Example:**

```html
8 &gt; 2
```

It might not make sense seeing this example, but whent the browser encounters this, it translates it to the correct symbol.

Other examples include:

1. `&nbsp;` - a non-breaking space
2. `&copy;` - copyright symbol
3. `&quot;` - single quote
4. `&reg;` - registered trademark

> HTML Entities start with `&` and end with a `;`.
