# HTML Semantic Elements

> A semantic element is an element that makes sense in meaning both to the browser and the developer.

HTML5 introduced a number of semantic elements which we are going to go through one by one.

## `<article>`
This defines content which is independent of other content within the website. For example, if you display book titles and excerpts as a grid on your website, then you can use the `article` tag to achieve this.

**Example:**
```html
<article>
  <h2>Diary of a wimpy kid</h2>
  <p>This is a story of a boy who used to cry a lot.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
  <p>...a mother who loved her child enough to repel a curse</p>
</article>
```

> The `article` tag can be used interchangeably with the `div` tag.

## `<aside>`

## `<details>`

## `<figcaption>`

## `<figure>`

## `<footer>`

## `<header>`

## `<main>`

## `<mark>`

## `<nav>`

## `<section>`

## `<summary>`

## `<time>`
