# Welcome to learnerspree

learnerspree is an online educational platform where you can teach yourself how to code using examples and detailed explanations from instructors.

## Current Support

Currently, we are working on HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages alone. Once we are done with that, then we will move on to create documentation and projects for other languages and frameworks.

In case you encounter any mistakes in this documentation, please feel free to make changes from the repository, after which they will be approved and published to the website. Thank you.
