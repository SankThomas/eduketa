# Learn ReactJs

| Please note that we are going to use JavaScript in relation to React. We are not going to use TypeScript unless explicitly stated.

I have written a book on The Fundamentals Of ReactJs which you can take a look at on [my Gumroad Profile](https://tsbsankara.gumroad.com). For only $20, you can grab yourself a copy of the book, or, if you are fast enough, use code TOM10 on checkout to get 50% off your purchase. Any purchase is extremely helpful and very much appreciated.
