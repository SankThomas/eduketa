# Introduction to React Hooks

React hooks are a way to use React state and lifecycle methods while inside function components, that is, to **hook into** React's full capabilities. This therefore means that you cannot use hooks outside of function components â€“ which therefore means that we are going to be working solely inside React function components in the examples we will encounter.

React hooks were introduced in React version 16.8 in order to better create and manage state in React applications.

  We are going to use JavaScript in relation to React. We are
  not going to use TypeScript unless explicitly stated. If you want to see TypeScript instead, consider becoming a contributor to the project.
