# Data Types

A data type is a kind of item that is defined by the values it can take, and the operations that can be performed on it. JavaScript has 8 kinds of data types, but we are going to look at only 7 in this module, because the eight one needs a whole page dedicated to it.

## String

## Number

## Boolean

## Undefined

## Null

## Symbol

## Object

## BigInt

This is the last remaining data type we have. You can find it [here](/web-development/javascript/bigint)
