# Loops

<Callout>This page is under Construction</Callout>

Loops are a way to do something, that is, to execute a certain command or block of code, repeatedly, or over a set number of times. Looping over items is called **iteration**.

To iterate means is to perform something again and again.

The way loops work is that they iterate over your code block until a certain condition is met, after which they stop, or until they encounter the `break` statement - just like in a [`switch`](/web-development/javascript/control-flow#switch)

## The `for` loop

The `for` loop repeats until your condition evaluates to false, after which is breaks out of the loop. It has the syntax:

``` javascript
for (initialization; condition; afterthought) {
  // Some code block
}
```

> Note that we use semicolons and not commas!

**For Example:**

``` javascript
for (let age = 10; age < 8; age++) {
  console.log("This is a minor");
}
```

The above code block will be executed in the following way:

<Steps>
### Initialization

First, a variables with the name `age` will be initialized to a value of `10`. This initialization can also be defined outside of the `for` loop in the following way:

``` javascript
let age = 10;
for (age; age < 8; age++) {
  console.logo("This is a minor");
}
```

### Check the condition

Next, JavaScript will move to check whether the condition you have passed in evaluates to either `true` or `false`. If it evaluates to `true` then the loop will continue to the next phase which is the `afterthought` where something like an increment or decrement to your conditional value happens. However, if it evaluates to false, then JavaScript will break out of the loop and stop its execution.

In the example above, our condition evaluates to `true` because. Therefore, we move on to the `afterthought`.

### Afterthought

Here, you can do something like increment or decrement your conditinoal value so that at one time, the condition will have to evaluate to false so that you don't end up with an infinite loop.

In our example above, we increment our `age` value by 1 for every time that the condition is `true`. This will make the loop run only two times - because we will increment `age` from 8 to 10 only two times. When this happens, our condition for the age being less than 10 is now no longer being met. Therefore, it breaks out of the loop and it evaluates to `false`.
</Steps>

## The `for...in` loop

This is used to loop over the properties of an object. It has the syntax:

``` javascript
for (let i in objectname) {
  // Some code block
}
```

**For Example:**

``` javascript
// Create an object
const person = {
  name: "Thomas",
  age: 27,
}

// Loop over the object properties
for (let i in person) {
  console.log(person[i]); // Will return Thomas and 27 as indivdual object values.
}
```

It can also be used to loop over an array:

**For Example:**

``` javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

for (let i in numbers) {
  console.log(numbers[i]); // Will return the individual elements of the numbers array
}
```

## The `for...of` loop

The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, Maps and NodeLists or an object that has iterable properties.

**For Example:**

``` javascript
let languages = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java"];

for (let x of language) {
  console.log(x); // Will log out the individual languages
}
```

  ### The difference between `for...of` and `for...in`
  
  Using the example above, the `for...of` loop will display the values of the array, but if you use `for...in`, it will log out the index of the items.

## The `while` loop

## The `do...while` loop

## The `break` statement

## The `continue` statement
