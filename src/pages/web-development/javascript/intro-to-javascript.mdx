# Learn JavaScript

JavaScript is the interactive language of the web, and it runs most of the websites you see on the web today.

Websites such as Facebook, Instagram, X and YouTube are all run using JavaScript - technically they use frameworks, but the frameworks are written in JavaScript.

Therefore, for any prospective front-end web developer, you need to learn JavaScript in order to build interactive web apps. 

Even if you don't want to become a front-end web developer, JavaScript is still used in the back-end for databases, for desktop applications using ElectronJs and for mobile development using frameworks such as React Native and Ionic.

Welcome to JavaScript!
