# Variables

<Callout>This page is under Construction</Callout>

Variables are "containers" in your code that hold specific values called identifiers. For example:

``` javascript
age = 26;
```

Above, `age` is the identifier and `26` is the value assigned to the variable.

## Declaring variables

In JavaScript, variables can be declared in 5 ways:

<Steps>
  ### Automatically

  In JavaScript, you can declare variables automatically by not using any of the keywords `var`, `let` or `const`. This results in a global variable that is accessible anywhere in your application. For example:

  ``` javascript
  age = 26; // This is a global variable
  ```

  However, it is not recommended that you declare variables in this way because it may result in unintended consequences in your application. For example, you might reuse the same variable name in a different part of your application and reassign the value to it - which nullifies the initial declaration. Therefore, if some code was relying on the initial declaration, it is now moot. Do you get it?

  In order to curb this, in 2009, ECMAScript5 (ES5) introduced `strict mode` which throws an error if you use an undeclared variable.
  
  <Callout type="info">
     Strict mode prohibits some JS syntax and eliminates silent errors by making them throw errors.

    > ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, most popularly JavaScript, but also JScript and ActionScript and other scripting languages, that ensures interoperability of web pages across different browsers.
  </Callout>

  ### Using the `var` keyword

  <Callout type="warning">
    You should only use the `var` keyword if you want your web app to be completely compatible with old browsers. In newer code, use `let` and `const`.
  </Callout>

  ### Using the `let` keyword

  ### Using the `const` keyword

  ### Destructuring

## Rules for writing variables

<Steps>
### Variables should be declared before they are used

It goes without saying that you should declare a variable before you attempt to use it in your code, especially when you are using strict mode and don't want to run into many errors.

### Identifiers are case-sensitive

JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. Therefore, any user-defined identifiers are also case sensitive. This means that `number = 20` and `Number = 20` are two different variables.

### Names can contain letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs

The following declarations are all correct, and define three different variables with the same value.

``` javascript
  const number = 20;
  const number20 = 20;
  const $number = 20;
  const _number20 = 20;
```

### Names cannot be reserved words

Reserved words are words that JavaScript has set apart to be used to perform certain things. For example, `let` and `const` are reserved words used to declare variables. Therefore, something similar to the example below will result in an error:

``` javascript
  let const = 20;
  const let = 20;
```

However, this is correct:

``` javascript
  let number = 20;
  const age = 20;
```

</Steps>

## JavaScript Assignment Operator

In all of the above examples, you have noticed that we have used the `=` sign. In JavaScript, this not the Equal Sign. It is the Assignment Operator. Meaning, it assigns the value on the right, to the identifier on the left.

If you want the Equal Sign in JavaScript, you use double equal signs, i.e `==`.

And if you want strict equality, that is, if you want to check whether two operands are equal and of the same type, you use triple equal signs: `===`.
