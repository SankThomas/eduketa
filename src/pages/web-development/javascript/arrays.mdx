# Arrays

<Callout>This page is under Construction</Callout>

Arrays are a special type of variable that can hold multiple values. We already know how to declare variables in JavaScript, so take a look at the example below:

``` javascript
const bestBrand = "Porsche";
const averageBrand = "Toyota";
const notGoodBrand = "Range Rover";
```

In the example above, we have declared three variables containing brands of cars. But what if you were to declare all the brands of cars in existence today? How many variables would you create? Do you get the picture?

Let's see how you would solve this conundrum using arrays:

``` javascript
const brands = ["Porsche", "Toyota", "Range Rover"];
```

Above, we have declared an array called **brands** and set it to hold the three car brands. You even eliminate the deliberate biasness I added when declaring "bestBrand", "averageBrand" and "notGoodBrand", by having one variable name for all the brands.

<Callout type="info">
  Note the syntax of an array...it has to be enclosed in square brackets and the values separated with commas.
</Callout>

Arrays are especially useful when you are declaring varibales of the same type. You can take a look at a more advanced example below: [Advanced Arrays](#advanced-arrays)

## How to write arrays

#### Using array literals

We have already seen this methods in action in the example above. It is simply declaring a variable name and assigning values to it. Take a look below:

``` javascript
// Example 1
const brands = [];
brands[0] = "Volvo";
brands[1] = "Tesla";
brands[2] = "Man";
brands[3] = "Mercedes";

// Example 2
const brands = ["Volvo", "Tesla", "Man", "Mercedes"];
```

The two examples above do the exact same thing. However, method one is only used when you don't know the values of your array beforehand, while method two is use when you know the values of your array at the time of declaration.

To better understand **Example 1**, read more about [Accessing the values of an array](#accessing-the-values-of-an-array).


#### Using the `new` keyword

The `new` keyword is a reserved word in JavaScript, and you can use it to declare an array in the following way:

`const myArray = new Array("Porsche", 'Toyota', "Range Rover");`

Note that when you use the keyword `new` you no longer use square brackets for your array values.

Read more about the `new` reserved keywords in [JavaScript Reserved Words](/web-development/javascript/reserved-words).

For purposes of readability as well as code execution speed, it is recommended to use the array literal method.

## Accessing the values of an array

You can access the values of an array using square brackets, and the index of the item you want to read.

Using the very same example above, if I wanted to access the brand **Toyota**, I would say:

``` javascript
const brands = ["Porsche", "Toyota", "Range Rover"];

// Our new variable that holds the value we are accessing
const toyota = brands[1];
console.log(toyota);

// Expected result in the console: Toyota
```

You can also access the values of an array using the `at()` method. For example:

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
console.log(fruits.at(2)); // Returns: pear 
```

Read more about the `at()` method in [Array Methods](#array-methods#at).

### Array Indexing

In the above example, we are accessing the brand Toyota, which, using basic math, is the second item out of three items in our array. So why are we accessing it's value using `brands[1]`?

Because arrays are indexed from 0. Meaning JavaScript (and other programming languages) doesn't start counting the number of items of an array from 1...it starts from 0. Therefore, reading the remaining values is as follows:

``` javascript
  const porsche = brands[0]; // reads the value Porsche, the first item, index 0
  const toyota = brands[1]; // reads the value Toyota, the second item, index 1
  const rangeRover = brands[2]; // reads the value Range Rover, the third item, index 2
```

<Callout type="info">
  Arrays are indexed from 0. Therefore, if you want to access the last item, you need to get the length of the array, i.e, the number of items in the array, and then minus one from that value. See the example below:

  ``` javascript
    const brands = ["Porsche", "Toyota", "Range Rover"];

    const lastItem = brands.length - 1;
    console.log(lastItem); // Expected Result: Range Rover
  ```

  **`.length`** is an array method that you can read more about in the [Array Methods](#array-methods) section.
</Callout>

## Advanced Arrays

When speaking about advanced arrays, I don't mean arrays that have a degree or anything, but about how you can write arrays that hold much more data than just simple names of car brands.

Usually, when you will be working with APIs, you will find that they are arrays structured using objects. This is called an array of objects, i.e, an array that contains objects as its main value.

**For example:**

``` javascript
  const brands = [
    {
      name: "Supra",
      brand: "Toyota",
      weight: {
        imperial: 3300,
        metric: 1500
      },
      top_speed: 330,
      horsepower: 780,
      torque: 1000,
    },
    {
      name: "Lexus",
      brand: "Toyota",
      weight: {
        imperial: 4000,
        metric: 1800
      },
      top_speed: 280,
      horsepower: 800,
      torque: 920,
    },
  ]
```

Objects are another type of data structure that are declared using curly brackets in JavaScript. Read more about objects in [JavaScript Objects](/web-development/javascript/objects).

Above, we have the same array called **brands**, but with a slightly different structure. This time, we are using an object, and instead of just giving the brand name, we give the car some values that make it more descriptive such as its weight, top speed, horsepower and torque.

In the above example, you can see that arrays can span multiple lines. This is because whitespaces are ignored when you declare an array.

#### Note

You can make an array as convoluted as you want in order for it to serve its purpose. But, as I have cautioned before, always remember that you or someone else will have to read through all that and you don't want to subject yourself to self-inflicted torture.

### Converting an Array to a String

Take a look at this example:

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
```

You can convert this to a string using the `.toString()` method.

``` javascript
console.log(fruits.toString()); // Expected Result: banana,orange,pear,apple,mango
```

Note that when you convert an array into a string, it returns the array as a comma separated string.

<Callout type="info">
### Arrays are Objects

Arrays are considered objects in JavaScript. See the example below:

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];

console.log(typeof fruits); // Expected Result: object
```

The **typeof** operator in JavaScript returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value.

**For example:**
``` javascript
console.log(typeof 20); // Returns "number"
console.log(typeof "thomas"); // Returns "string"
console.log(typeof true); // Returns "boolean"
console.log(typeof yourArray); // Returns "object"
```
</Callout>

### Array Methods
You can perform a number of functions on any array, ranging from getting the number of items in the array, to sorting the array in some type of order. Below are the common array methods.

#### length

This is used to get the number of items in an array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];

console.log(fruits.length); // Expected result: 5
```

In order to get the last element in an array, you use `length - 1`. For example:

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
console.log(fruits.length - 1); // Expected result: mango
```

You can also use the `.length` method to append another element to an existing array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
fruits[fruits.length] = "lemon";

console.log(fruits); // Expected result: ["banan", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango", "lemon"];
// Lemon is now added to the array
```

#### toString

This is used to converted an array into a comma separated list of values.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];

console.log(fruits.toString()); // Returns: banana,orange,pear,apple,mango
```

#### at

This returns an indexed element from an array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];

console.log(fruits.at(1)); // Returns: orange - because arrays are indexed from 0;
console.log(fruits.at(4)); // Returns: mango
```

#### join

Just like the `.toString()` method, `.join` also joins all array elements into one, with the additional control that you can specify the separator.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
fruits.join(" - ");
console.log(fruits); // Expected Result: banana - orange - pear - apple - mango
```

#### shift

This is used to remove the first element of an array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
fruits.shift();

console.log(fruits); // Expected result: ["orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"]
```

#### unshift

This is used to add a new element to the beginning of an array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
fruits.unshift("pineapple");

console.log(fruits); // Expected result: ["pineapple", "banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"]
```

#### concat

Concat is short for "concatenate"  which means "to join stings end to end". Therefore, using the `concat` method will join two array elements to one.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const carBrand = ["BMW M3"];
const carType = ["GTR E46"];
const carName = carBrand.concat(carType);

console.log(carName); // Expected result: BMW M3GTR E46
```

<Callout type="info">
  `concat` joins strings without adding a space, hence the result above. You can manually add a space to your string if you already know beforehand how your end string will be.

  However, another method, and more preferrable is to use `concat` along with the `join` method as below:

  ``` javascript
    const carName = carBrand.concat(carType).join(" "); // This joins the strings using a whitespace to improve readability.
    console.log(carName); // Expected result: BMW M3 GTR E46
  ```
</Callout>

#### copyWithin

#### flat

#### splice

#### toSpliced

#### slice

#### sort

#### map

#### pop

This removes the last element from an array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
fruits.pop();

console.log(fruits); // Expected result: ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple"]
```

#### push

This adds an element to the end of an array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
fruits.push("pineapple");

console.log(fruits); // Expected result: ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango", "pineapple"]
```

#### forEach

This is used to loop over the elements of an array. Using this, you can perform some function that will iterate over all the elements in the array.

**For example:**

``` javascript
const multiply = [2, 4, 6, 8];

multiply.forEach((number) => number * 2);
console.log(multiply); // Returns [4, 8, 12, 16]
```

#### isArray

The `isArray` method is used to test whether a variable is an array. For example:

``` javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "orange", "pear", "apple", "mango"];
Array.isArray(fruits);
```

This is because when we use `typeof` - which is the recommended way to know what type of value an operand is - to test whether a variable is an array, it returns `object` in JavaScript. The `isArray` method solves this issue.

The `isArray` method also solves another issue that is introduced by `new Array()`.

Usually, when you use `new Array` to declare an array, you will - most of the time - get the same results...except for one situation. See the example below:

``` javascript
const myArray = [10, 20, 30, 40];

const myArray = new Array(10, 20, 30, 40);
```

The above will do the exact same thing, that is, to create an array with four elements. However, take a look at the example below:

``` javascript
const myArray = [10];
// Creates an array with one item

const myArray = new Array(10);
// Creates an array containing 10 elements
```

Above, the array literal will create an array with one item. However, `new Array` will create an array with 10 elements! Take note of this.
