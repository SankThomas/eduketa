# Arithmetic Operators

Just like in Basic Maths, we can do Mathematical operations in a programming language. Think of addition, subtraction, division (without the long), multiplication, exponentiation, and modulus.

### Addition `+`

Represented by the `plus` symbol. It is used to add two operands together.

**Example:**

``` javascript
let total = 20 + 30;
```

### Subtraction `-`

Represented by the `minus` symbol. It used to get the difference between two operands.

**Example:**

``` javascript
let difference = 20 - 30; // Just like in Maths, numbers can be in the negative.
```

### Multiplication `*`

Represented by the `asterisk`. Since computers understand the letter X as the letter X, we cannot use it for multiplication like we do when writing. So, we use the asterisk symbol to multiply operands.

**Example:**

``` javascript
let product = 20 * 30;
```

### Division `/`

Represented by the forward slash. This is used to get the quotient between two operands.

**Example:**

``` javascript
let quotient = 20 / 4;
```

### Modulus `%`

Represented by the percent symbol. It is used to get the remainder of a division.

**Example:**

``` javascript
let modulus = 19 % 4; // Returns 3
```

> When you use modulus, the value you get back will be the remainder after division is done.

### Exponentiation `**`

Represented by double asterisks. It is used to get the power - to a certain value - of an operand.

**Example:**

``` javascript
let product2 = 20 ** 2; // 20 raised to the power of 2
let product3 = 20 ** 3; // 20 raised to the power of 3
let product4 = 20 ** 4; // 20 raised to the power of 4
```

## Operator precedence

Operator precedence means the order of execution of operations depending on the Mathematical Symbol used, i.e **BODMAS**.

BODMAS stands for **B**rackets, **O**rder of powers (also called **O**f), **D**ivision, **M**ultiplicataion, **A**ddition, and **S**ubtraction, and it behaves the same way in programming as it does in Mathametics:

Operands in brackets are executed first, then the order of powers, then divided, then multiplied, added and finally subtracted. Take a look at the example below:

``` javascript
let total = (40 - 20) / 3 * 10; // Returns 66.66 recurring
```

In the above example, we first get the value of `40 - 20` because they are in brackets, then we divide this new value by `3`, and then finally multiply it by `10`. Try to solve the examples below:

``` javascript
let total = 10 * 10 + 10;
let profit = 10 / 10 * 10;
let grossProfit = (2400 - 1500) / 12 * 100;
```

That is going to be it about Arithmetic Operators. Next, we are going to look at Logical Operators.
