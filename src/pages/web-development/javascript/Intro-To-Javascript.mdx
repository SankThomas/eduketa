# Learn JavaScript

JavaScript is the interactive language of the web, and it runs most of the websites you see on the web today.

Websites such as Facebook, Instagram, X and YouTube are all run using JavaScript - technically they use frameworks, but the frameworks are written in JavaScript.

Therefore, for any prospective front-end web developer, you need to learn JavaScript in order to build interactive web apps. 

Even if you don't want to become a front-end web developer, JavaScript is still used in the back-end for databases using NodeJs, for desktop applications using ElectronJs and for mobile development using frameworks such as React Native and Ionic.

JavaScript is **case-senstive**, meaning it takes into account capitalization of words used by programmers. Therefore, `number` and `Number` and `numBer` are three different things in JavaScript. Take note.

## How this section is structured

This section assumes no prior programming knowledge using JavaScript and is, therefore, structured in a way where all the relevant topics are covered before we begin integrating it to actual coding examples. Therefore, practical examples come last after all the topics have been covered. If you already have prior JavaScript coding experience, you can skip to the section about [Manipulating the DOM](/web-development/javascript/manipulating-the-dom).

Now that we have that covered, we can begin! Welcome to JavaScript!
