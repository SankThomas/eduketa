# Learn CSS

CSS Stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. It is the language of the web that is used to describe how HTML elements are presented to the user.

It is a rule-based language, in that, you describe a set of rules that are going to apply to elements in your HTML document.

Remember how we mentioned that HTML is the skeleton? Well, CSS is the muscles to the skeleton.

In the following modules, we are going to learn all about how to style elements in our webpages, including how to add beautiful animations.

## Prerequisites

Before we can begin typing away, we need to get a few things out of the way:

1. Install a code editor to write your programs. I personally prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) but you are free to use whatever code editor you are comfortable with such as Atom, Sublime Text, Webstorm or even Notepad.
2. If you don't have access to a code editor or you are unable to install one, then there are online code editors that work brilliantly even on mobile phones. However, if you are just beginning to learn how to code, I don't recommend that you start with an online code editor because they do a lot of things under the hood, which you can only learn when you are doing them yourself.

- Examples of online code editors are:
  1. [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
  2. [Codepen](https://codepen.io)
  3. [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)
  4. [VsCode.dev](https://vscode.dev)
  5. [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
  6. [JSBin](https://jsbin.com)

3. A passion to learn. Sometimes it's easy to begin something, but it can become hard to see it all the way through. I hope this documentation is easy to understand to help you through to the end.
