# Working With Fonts

Fonts play a huge role in the feeling you want your website to portray, therefore, choosing good fonts is a skill you will have to learn.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) is a great place to begin looking at fonts you want to include in your website. However, because it has thousands of fonts, you quickly run into a dilemma of choice.

Enter [Fontpair.co](https://fontpair.co). This is a great website (that takes the Google fonts you failed to choose beforehand) and pairs them for you so that you can just choose a pairing you love.

## Choosing fonts

Just as it is important to choose the correct font for programming, i.e. a monospace font, it is just as important to choose the fonts you want for your website. For example, if you want to portray a professional look, you should probably choose a Serif font such as Inter. If you want a children's look, a cursive font would do well...and you get the gist.

You will probably want to choose a heavy font for your headings, and a lighter font for the rest of your text.
