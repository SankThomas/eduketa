# CSS Media Queries and Responsiveness

<Callout type="info">This page is under construction</Callout>

Responsiveness refers to the ability of your website to resize correctly, and show all the relevant content appropriately on all types of devices, from smartphone watches to 4K UHD devices.

In order to achieve this, web developers use media queries. These are a type of at-rule that allow us to define certain styles to apply for certain device widths.

Usually, web developers begin by building the mobile version of a website before scaling it up to tablet versions (and we all collectively wish designers would give us mobile versions first - but wishes are not horses) and finally laptop and desktop versions. This is because it is easier to scale things up than down. However, media queries also provide a way for us to build a desktop version first and then scale it down, but, from experience, it's much harder, and the result might be a bit ugly-looking. That, or I'm just a bad programmer.

You can also use media queries to style how you want a printer to interpret a document before printing it. We are going to look at how to do all that in this module.


## The `@media` at-rule

We are all wowed about how some websites look so amazing both on phone and on desktop, and we wonder how much time it must have taken the designers and developers to come up with something so amazing.

This is all possible using the `@media` rule. In the previous module, we brushed over the `@emdia` at-rule because we are going to delve into it in this module.

It has the syntax:

```css
@media (ruleset) {
    /* Styles you want to apply */
}
```

The ruleset above can be one of the following:

1. `min-width`
2. `max-width`
3. `orientation`
4. `screen`
5. `print`
6. `prefers-color-scheme`

### `min-width`

This is used to define an increasing width up to which styles will apply. For example:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    section {
        background-color: orange;
    }
}
```

The `section` will have a background color beginning `768px` going upwards. Meaning, beginning tablet-size screens and upwards to laptops and desktops and any other devices with a larger screen will have a background color of orange on the section.

<Callout type="info">`min-width` will apply the styles to devices that have a larger width than the one specified.</Callout>

### `max-width`

This is used to define an decreasing width of devices which will have the styles specified applied. For example:

```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    section {
        background-color: orange;
    }
}
```

The `section` will have a background color beginning `767px` going downwards. Meaning, devices that have a smaller with than 767px such as most mobile phones (discounting the flip phones that becomes tablets) will have a background color of orange applied to the section. 

<Callout type="info">`max-width` will apply the styles to devices that have a smaller width than the one specified.</Callout>

### `orientation`

This defines the styles which you want applied for when the device is either in portrait or landscape mode (when the device width is greater than its height). For example:

```css
/* Landscape mode */
@media (orientation: landscape) {
    section {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
    }
}

/* Portrait mode */
@media (orientation: portrait) {
    section {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `section` will align its elements in row for when the device is in landscape mode, and in column form when the device is in portait mode.

### `screen`

This is used to define screens such as laptops, desktops and smartphones. For example:


```css
@media screen {
    section {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```

### `print`

This is used to define how you want your website to look like when it is printed on paper. For example:

```css
@media print {
    body {
        background-color: #ececec,
        color: #333333,
        padding: 32px 24px;
    }
}
```

### `prefers-color-scheme`

This is used to detect whether the user has set their device theme to light to dark mode, and applies the styles you define appropriately. For example:

```css
/* Styles for light theme */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
    body {
        background-color: #f1f1f1;
        color: #333333;
    }
}

/* Styles for dark theme */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body {
        background-color: #333333;
        color: #f1f1f1;
    }
}
```

## Device Breakpoints

Bootstrap defines breakpoints as:
> Customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes.

Now, if you're new to web development, you might be wondering how people just decide what widths they want to use as the device breakpoints.

Well, it's simple. We just use the device widths from phone manufacturers. For example, the JioPhone 2 has a device width of 240px, the Galaxy Fold has a width of 280px, the iPhone 4 has a width of 320px, the Samsung Galaxy is 360px, the iPad Mini is 768px, the iPad Air is 820px, most laptops are 1024px, large desktops are 1920px and above.

When you think about it, there's not really many media queries that you will need to add in order to make your website responsive on all, or most, devices. For example, the styles you apply for the Galaxy Fold can apply till the Google Pixel 4 phone which is about 400px. In the same way, the styles you apply for a laptop of screen width 1280px can apply to another computer of screen width 1600px - almost a 400px difference.

If you feel like this is too much to remember, don't remember them. All you have to do is use the Inspect tool in any brower worthy of the name and it will have popular device widths for you to toggle. See the image below:


Also, the more you write media queries, the better you will remember them, and you will even begin to predict how your website is going to look like before you write them.

## Combining media queries

You can combine media queries using the logical `and` operator. This can be useful if you want to specify multiple conditions for which you want the styles to apply. For example, if you want to target a device that is in landspace mode, and also has a width of at least 400px, then you would do something like in the example below:

```css
@media (orientation: landscape) and (min-width: 400px) {
    /* Styles to apply */
}
```

Because of the logical AND, the styles in the example above will only apply when both conditions evaluate to TRUE. If one of them evaluates to FALSE, then the media query will not apply.

If you wanted to targer a specific device such as the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, you would do something similar to the example below:

```css
@media ((min-width: 1px) and (max-width: 412px) and (min-height: 1px) and (max-height: 915px)) {
    /* Styles to apply */
}
```

Something important to note with the example above, however, is that if another device happens to fall within the dimensions specified in the media query, the styles will also apply to it.

You can combine media queries however you want, just make sure to test them to ensure they actually work, and you don't accidentally break the user experience by applying styles you don't intend to.

## Comma separated media queries

Above, we have talked about the logical AND operator to combine media queries. You can also use the logical OR operator - but without the keyword OR. Instead it is replaced with a comma.

For example:

```css
@media (orientation: landscape), (min-width: 400px) {
    /* Styles to apply */
}
```

The above styles will apply if one, or both of the conditions return TRUE. If both conditions evaluate to FALSE, the media query will not apply.
