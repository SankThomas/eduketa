# CSS At Rules

<Callout type="info">This page is under construction</Callout>

At rules in CSS are statements that give specific instructions on how CSS should behave when the condition inside the rule is fulfilled.

They have the syntax:

```css
@identifier (rule);
```

> CSS At rules always begin with the `@` symbol - hence the name "At" rules.

Below are the CSS At rules that you will come across in your web development career.

### `@charset`
### `@color-profile`
### `@container`
### `@counter-style`
### `@font-face`
### `@font-feature-values`
### `@font-palette-values`
### `@import`
### `@keyframes`
### `@layer`
### `@media`
### `@namespace`
### `@page`
### `@property`
### `@supports`
