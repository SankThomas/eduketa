This page showcases the projects that you can expect to build - and build upon once completed - once you have completed going through this.

## We are going to build the following projects.

1. Basic React Application
2. Counter App
3. React Hooks
4. Accordion

### Basic React Application

In this first project, we are going to begin with the most simple project we can build in React: a Hello World! App. It is the custom of our people, the programmers, to always build an app like this when learning any new language.

To begin, open up a terminal window and type in the following command:
`npx create-react-app hello-world` where `hello-world` is the name of your application.

View the image below to see what you should be having.

NOTE: At the time of writing, I am running React version 18. So please take note if you are reading this some time in the future when more updates to the framework have been made.
