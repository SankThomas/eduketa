# CSS Selectors And How To Style Elements

<Callout type="info">This page is under construction</Callout>

CSS Selectors refers to the way in which we "target" elements in our HTML files so that we can apply CSS styling to them.

The following are the commonly used CSS Selectors:

1. [Element names](#element-names)
2. [Class names](#class-names)
3. [Id names](#id-names)
4. [The Universal selector](#the-universal-selector)
5. [Combinators](#combinators)

## Element Names

This refers to simply targetting the element by its name, such as `div`, or `section`, or `button`, or `input` or any other element name that you have present in your HTML document.

**Example:**

```css
div {
  background-color: indigo;
}

button {
  color: white;
}
```


## Class Names

This involves giving the elements a `class` attribute which you can then use in your CSS.

**Example:**

```html
<!-- In your HTML -->
<section class="mysection">
  <p>Yes, but why is the rum gone?</p>
</section>
```

And in your CSS file:

```css
.mysection {
  background-color: gray;
  color: white;
}
```

Notice how, when defining the styles for the section above in our CSS, we use a dot(`.`) before the name of the class: that is: `.mysection` and not just `mysection`.

This is consistent with how you write CSS code for classes. The dot tells the browser that it is a CSS class that has been applied, and it should check the CSS file for the corresponding class name and apply the styles therein.

Class attributes can be reused on whatever elements you want to have the styles that you have defined. For example:

```html
<!-- In your HTML -->
<section class="mysection">
  <p>Yes, but why is the rum gone?</p>
</section>

<section class="mysection">
  <p>I burnt it all to make a fire</p>
</section>
```

And in your CSS file:

```css
/* In your CSS */
.mysection {
  background-color: gray;
  color: white;
}
```

## Id Names



## The Universal Selector 


## Combinators


There are also more advanced selectors - advanced in that you can go "inside" the element and select elements based on certain characteristics. For example:

1. [Attribute Selectors](#attribute-selectors)
2. [Pseudo Selectors](#attribute-selectors)
