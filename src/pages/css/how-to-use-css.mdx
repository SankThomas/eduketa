# How To Add CSS Styles To Your HTML

<Callout type="info">This page is under construction</Callout>

The next prudent question to ask ourselves is, how do we add CSS to our HTML to make it appealing? Because HTML on it's own is actually quite terrible looking.

There are three ways that you can add CSS to your HTML.

### 1. Inline CSS

This refers to adding styles right within the HTML element - as we have been doing in the HTML examples. It involves adding the `style` attribute and then the properties you want to add.

**Example:**

```html
<div style="background-color: red">
    This is a section with a red background color.
</div>
```

This will create a section with a red background color.

### 2. Internal CSS



### 3. External CSS

In your HTML document, in the `head` of your HTML, you can link your stylesheet in the following way:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" />
```

Once you do this, you can begin to add relevant styles in your CSS file and they will apply to the current document.

This is the main way - and also the recommended way - that you will be using to add your CSS files to your HTML documents.

> NOTE: It is the recommended way. However, even when you have an external CSS file, always select the most convenient one for what you are currently doing. For example, sometimes you need to apply overriding styles to your elements. This is where [CSS Specificity](/css/cascading) comes in. More on this in that module.
