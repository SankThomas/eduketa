# The Cascading Nature Of CSS

<Callout type="info">This page is under construction</Callout>

The **C** in CSS stands for Cascading. Cascading means that CSS will apply styles to your HTML webpage according to how the styles are defined, from top to bottom.

What this also means is that styles that are located more to the bottom of your CSS file will be intepreted as having more significance than the other styles.

This means that if you define one section that has two classes and you style out the classes to have different background colors, the class that is more to the bottom of your file is going to have priority over the first defined style.

**Example:**

```html
<section class="banner showcase">
  <!-- Some content here -->
</section>
```

```css
.banner {
  background-color: violet;
}

.showcase {
  background-color: purple;
}
```

In the above example, the styles of the `.showcase` class will be applied over the styles of the `.banner` class.

This is the basic concept of how CSS styles are applied. However, there are certain rules that are overt to this - and they belong to what is called CSS Specificity.

## CSS Specificity

CSS styles that are located more to the bottom of your CSS file have more priority than other styles applied above. This is called CSS Specificity. (It's a hard word to pronounce).

This is one rule for CSS Specificity. However, there are exceptions to this rule which we are going to discuss below:

### 1. Element Names Vs Class Names

Class names have higher specificity than element names. This means that if you have a section which you style using its name: i.e. `section` - and you style the same section using a class name that you have applied on it, the styles of the class name will apply over the styles on the element name.

**Example:**

```html
<section class="banner">
  <!-- Some content here -->
</section>
```

```css
/* Styles using element name */
section {
  background-color: firebrick;
}

/* Styles using class name */
.banner {
  background-color: violet;
}
```

In the above example, what you will end up with is a section with a violet background color.

<Callout type="info">
It is important to note that only the styles that you change in the more specific class that you are styling, will apply. For example, if I applied a height of `100px` to the section (not the class) then the section will have a height of `100px`, even when I style it out using the class name. This is because, it the class name, which is more specific, I am not changing the `height` property - I am only changing the `background-color` property.

This also means that if I now change the `height` to something else, then the section will now use the `height` I have applied on the more specific class name.

</Callout>

Still using the example above, what if I styled the class name before styling the element name? This way, the element name will be more to the bottom of the CSS file and have more specificity, right? Well, as true as the statement might be, the class name will still take priority. For example:

```html
<section class="banner">
  <!-- Some content here -->
</section>
```

```css
/* Styles using class name */
.banner {
  background-color: violet;
}

/* Styles using element name */
section {
  background-color: firebrick;
}
```

> The element name comes last, but the background color of the section will still be violet because of specificity.

### 2. Element names Vs Id attributes

Just like with class names, styles on the `id` attribute will take precedence over styles applied using element names.

**Example:**

```html
<section id="showcase">
  <!-- Some content here -->
</section>
```

```css
section {
  background-color: indigo;
}

#showcase {
  background-color: navy;
}
```

In this case, the styles of the `#showcase` will apply and the styles of the `section` will not apply. The same will happen even if you define the `#showcase` styles first before defining the `section` classes.

<Callout type="info">
### Once again

Something important to note is that only the styles you change in the more specific styles will apply. Meaning, untouched style properties will remain untouched.

**Example:**

```css
section {
  height: 80px;
  background-color: yellow;
}

#showcase {
  background-color: red;
}
```

The section is still going to have a height of `80px` because we have not tampered with the `height` property in the styles for the `#showcase`.

### `id` attributes Vs `class` attributes


### Element Name Vs `id` Vs `class`

### The `!important` rule
