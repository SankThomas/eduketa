# Rules for writing HTML
Even though HTML is not a programming language, it has some rules and conventions that help developers put out clean, easy-to-read, and maintainable code.

### Always have an `index.html` file in your workspace

### Always declare the document type
In HTML5, we declare the document type by adding the line `<!DOCTYPE html>`. By doing this, you tell the browser that you are about to write code using HTML5 standards. Always declare this line at the very top of your document.

### Use lowercase element and attribute names
Once again, HTML is not a programming language. Therefore, it is not case sensitive. This means that if you declare a section using the `section` element, you can declare it in lowercase or in uppercase.

This means that `<section>` and `<SECTION>` will both render a section in your webpage.

However, it is not recommended to use uppercase letters because they are hard to read. The convention is to use lowercase letters because they are both easier to read and write, and the overall code is prettier.

Also, do not mix lowercase and uppercase letters, such as `seCTion`. Even though it will not break your website, if you go back to your code in a few weeks or months, you are going to experience self-inflicted intellectual torture.

### Always close corresponding tags
"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction", said Newton. HTML replied and said, "Yes. And almost every opening tag must have an equal and corresponding closing tag".

HTML tags are opened by surrounding the element name with angle brackets(`<>`) and they are closed by adding a forward slash (`/`) after the first opening angle bracket (`</>`). Take a look at the example below:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Eduketa</title>
  </head>
  </body>
    Eduketa is an  amazing platform for learning web development.
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice how all the opening tags have their corresponding closing tags. The top `<html>` element has its closing `</html>` tag at the bottom. The `head`, `title` and `body` elements also have their corresponding opening and closing tags.

Note however, that there are some tags that don't need to be closed in order for them to work - but it is recommended that you close them. For example, the code block below gives an example of the `<p>` (paragraph) tag which is used to render text to the screen.

```
<!-- First Block -->
  <p>Some text here
  <p>Some other text here

<!-- Second block -->
  <p>Some text here</p>
  <p>Some other text here</p>
```

The first block is not closed. The second block is closed. Even though they do the same thing, the second way is the recommended way to do it as it also helps to avoid confusion, and to follow the convention so that other people can also read and understand your code, and help you out by contributing to your codebase.

### Close empty elements
We have just seen how we should always close all opening tags. Now, we are going to go further and learn that even thought the premiering statement is true, there are some elements that are exempt to this rule.

Some elements have an opening tag but they do not have a corresponding closing tag. These elements are called **"self-closing tags"** or **"empty elements"**

Examples include:
1. `<meta />` - used to add metadata in your website
2. `<img />` - used to add images to your website
3. `<input />` - used to create an input element
4. `<br />` - introduces a line break (new line) in your document
5. `<hr />` - introduced a horizontal line
6. `<link>` - is used to link stylesheets
7. `<source />` - used to link multiple sources of a piece of media

Notice how the all have a space and then an ending forward slash? These are completely optional. You can safely remove them and remain with only the angle brackets and the tag name. Both ways are an acceptable convention.

### Always quote attribute names
Attributes are used to give additional information about an element, and they usually come in key-value pairs: i.e name="some_name". For example, I can add a `height` attribute to a `section` as follows:

```
<section height="100px">...some text...</section>
```
The attribute name is always placed in quotation marks.

The following are the most common types of attributes:

1. `href` - is used to define a hyperlink that links to external web pages, or to other pages within the same website.

**Example:** `<a href="https://eduketa.com/blog">Read More</a>`

2. `src` - is used together with the `img` tag to define the relative path or internet link to the image to be displayed.

**Example:** `<img src="https://eduketa.com/logo" />`

3. `width` - is used to define the width of an element.

**Example:** `<img src="https://eduketa.com/logo" width="200px" />`

4. `height` - is used to define the height of an element.

**Example:** `<img src="https://eduketa.com/logo" height="200px" />`

5. `alt` - is used together with the `img` tag to define some text that will show to the user in case an image fails to load. Make sure to make this descriptive enough for both people and machines to understand. People because it is informational, and machines because they index your webpage and `alt` attributes improve your SEO and ranking in search results.

**Example:** `<img src="https://eduketa.com/logo" alt="Eduketa logo" />`

6. `style` - is used to define CSS styles that will only apply to that specific element.

**Example:** `<section style="background-color: red">...some text...</section>`

7. `lang` - is used to define the language of the document.

**Example:** `<html lang="en">`

8. `title` - is used to create a tooltip that will show when the user hovers over the element that has this attribute.

**Example:** `<a href="/next-page" title="Click me to go to the next page">Next Page</a>`

### Always specify an `alt` attribute for images
`alt` attributes are used to give information about images in case they fail to load. This can be helpful to end users because, rather than sitting and waiting for an image that will never load, they will see the text, and perhaps reload the page.

**Example:** `<img src="https://eduketa.com/logo" alt="Eduketa logo" />`

However, HTML does accept that decorative images such as icons do not need to have an `alt` attribute.

### Avoid long code lines
### Avoid unnecessary spaces
### Blank lines and indentation
### Always have the `title` element
### Always have the `html`, `head`, and `body` tags
