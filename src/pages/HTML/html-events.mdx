# HTML Events

HTML has the ability to trigger certain actions when a user interacts with elements on the webpage. These actions are called "Events" and usually need the assistance of JavaSctipt to achieve the correct behaviour.

Examples of events are: a user submitting a form, clicking a button and scrolling. Ssee further examples below:

These events are added as attributes to HTML elements as in the example below:

```html
<form onsubmit="handleSubmit()">
  <!-- Rest of code -->
</form>
```
