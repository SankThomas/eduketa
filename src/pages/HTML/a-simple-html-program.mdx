# A Simple HTML Program

What does HTML code look like? See the example below. Don't worry if you don't immediately understand what the code does, as it will be explained in a moment.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A Simple HTML Program</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A Simple HTML Program</h1>
  </body>
</html>

```

Save this file as `index.html` and then open it up using `Live Server` or double click it to open it in your favorite browser. What you will see on the screen is the image below:

Congratulations! You have just written your first HTML document.

## What does the code do?

The line `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that it is about to receive an HTML document. This type of declaration is for HTML5. Previous versions of HTML also had their own `Doctype` declarations listed below:

```
The HTML 4.01 strict doctype.
The HTML 4.01 transitional doctype.
The XML 1.0 strict and transitional doctypes.
The HTML 4.01 and XML 1.0 frameset doctypes.
```

(The source above is from Google)

The line `<html lang="en">` tells the browser to apply English as the primary language for the document.

The line `<head>...</head>` is used to insert items into the "invisible" (for lack of a better word) part of the website. Items such as `<script>` tags, analytics, cookies, CSS stylesheets, meta tags and document titles are all placed in the `head` of the HTML document.

The line `<title>A Simple HTML Program</title>` is the title of your HTML document that shows up in the address bar of your browser, in search results, and is also the title that shows when you `Alt + Tab` between screens. So make sure it's something meaningful and descriptive.

I have skipped over the `meta` tags because we are going to dive deeper into them in the module about Meta Tags.

## How is HTML processed?

HTML is processed by the browser at runtime. Meaning, when the browser receives the document, it goes through the document and renders it in a waterfall fashion, step-by-step, from top to bottom.

HTML is not a progamming language and will render elements as they are typed in. This means that if you make a mistake such as having multiple `<><><><>` tags, then the browser is going to render `<><><><>`, and it will be up to you to interpret them as errors and correct them. They do not show up as bugs or errors in your code!
