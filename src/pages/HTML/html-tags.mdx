# HTML Tags

> In this module, we are going to be looking a HTML tags in general, and then in a later module, we are going to look at those called "Semantic Elements", that were introduced in HTML5.

HTML tags or elements are keywords that tell the browser how it should format your webpage. For example, if you wanted to create a section, then you would create a `<div>` or a `<section>`. If you wanted to add an image to your webpage, you would create an `<img />` tag, among other examples, which we are going to look at below.

## `<a>`
This is called the **anchor** tag. It is used to link the pages in your website together, or to add links to other websites. For example, if you have a homepage and you want to add a link that goes to your about page, you would use this tag. In the same way, if you wanted to add your social media to your website, you would use anchor tags and then add the direct links to your social media profiles.

It has the syntax: 
```html
<a href="LINK_TO_WEBSITE">Text to show</a>
```

**Example:** The example below links to the "About Us" page
```html
<a href="about.html">About Us</a>
```

**Example using external links**
```html
<a href="https://twitter.com/@TSBSankara">@TSBSankara</a>
```

Sometimes you want that when users click on the links, they open up in new tabs. You can achieve this by adding an attribute on the anchor tag called `target` and setting it equal to `_blank`. For example, if you have an "About Us" page that you want to open on a new tab, you would do something similar to the example below:

```html
<a href="about.html" target="_blank">About Us</a>
```

> However, opening links in new tabs opens you up to a vulnerability called **Cross Site Scripting**, abbreviated as XSS. To avoid this, add another attribute called `rel` on the anchor tag and set it equal to `noreferrer`, as in the example below:

```html
<a href="about.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">About Us</a>
```

## `<article>`

## `<aside>`

## `<audio>`

## `<b>`
This is used to make text bold. It can be used in place of the `strong` tag which also makes text bold. Text that you want to make bold is text that you and your users are going to consider important. Simply wrap the text you want to be bold in this tag as in the example below:

```html
<b>I am important text because I am in bold</b>
```

## `<blockquote>`

## `<body>`
This tag contains all the visible content for your website. Everything that you want your users to interact with, to see or to read should be placed inside the body tags.

**Example:**
```html
<body>
  <article>
    <h1>Welcome to self-taught learning with Eduketa</h1>
    <p>Learn programming, transcription and even sybersecurity with our extensive documentation</p>
    <button>Show me how</button>
  </article>
</body>
```
