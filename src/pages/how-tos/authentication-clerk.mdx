# How to add authentication to you NextJs Application using Clerk

In this tutorial, we are going to create a new NextJs application and add Clerk authentication to manage user sign ups and sign ins, as well as protected routes. Let's begin.

<Steps>
### Step 1

Create a new NextJs application using the following command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest next-clerk-auth
```

This will create a new NextJs application for you called `next-clerk-auth`. Feel free to give this a different name if you want.

### Step 2

Open up your newly created application using your favorite code editor.

### Step 3

Navigate to the [Clerk Website](https://clerk.com) and create an account with them, or sign in if you already have an account. After a successfull sign on, you should be redirected into the clerk dashboard page similar looking to the one below:

Of course, if you have never used Clerk before, you won't have any applications on the landing page.

### Step 4

Install the Clerk SDK in your NextJs application using the following command:

```
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

### Step 5

Go ahead and create a new Clerk application and give it an appropriate name. The UI is intuitive and easy to follow and the log in settings can remain as default - and can be modified later in your settings.
